# Sahara Cryptocurrency 

We are creating own cryptocurrency named SAHARA on the ethereum blockchain using solidity programming language. Our cryptocurrency will comply with the ERC-20 standard so that it works seamlessly across all decentralized applications in the ethereum blockchain.

We have three modules in this project

## Initial Coin Offering

We have written smart contracts for the token and also for an Initial Coin Offering website using which we will have the ability to actually sell it to early investors at a discounted price.

## Cryptocurrency Exchange 
We are providing an exchange platform so that users may exchange Ether (ETH) with our cryptocurrency or exchange our cryptocurrency (SAHA) with Ether (ETH) at a fixed price.  This ensures that the user has an easy to use platform for exchanging their cryptocurrency without having the need for someone else to mediate the transaction and giving the go ahead, thus achieving instant exchange of cryptocurrency at a fixed price and at a much lower rate than traditional exchange platforms.

## Cryptocurrency Price Prediction
Given that we are providing a fixed trading price for Ethereum with our own cryptocurrency, it becomes imperative to know whether or not the time is right to buy and hold our token, since it is largely more affordable and interpretable, and by using the right machine learning algorithms, we can design a model that is able to work with a high degree of accuracy and provide customers, the ideal information going into the future for their successful investment.

We also compared ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to find out the best one for our use case, but the tests were not consistent across different cryptocurrencies and hence a single algorithm cannot be recommended out of these, and so, we provided support for all three.
